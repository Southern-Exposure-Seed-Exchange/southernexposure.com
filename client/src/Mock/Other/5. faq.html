<p></p><h2>Product Questions</h2><p></p>
<div class="question-answer" name="1"><p><strong>Where do your  seeds come from?</strong></p><p>Unlike most seed companies, we work directly with many small farmers who grow seed for us, and we grow seeds on our own farm.  Over half the varieties in our catalog and on our website are seed grown by this network. Many of these farms are in the Southeast; others are spread across the US.</p><p>We also buy seed from wholesale companies.  </p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="2"><p><strong>Where do  your seeds grow well?</strong></p><p>We choose  our variety selection based on what does well in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.  They generally will also do pretty well in  the Midwest (some of our seed growers are located there!)  If you live in the Deep South, look for pepper  and tomato varieties with good disease resistance, and for southern peas that  are vining types. If you live in the Northeast, North, or Pacific NW, when  looking for summer crops like tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, melons, peanuts, and  okra, choose ones with early maturity dates (listed at the beginning of the  variety descriptions).  In the Pacific  NW, some especially heat-loving crops like cotton, okra, and roselle don’t grow  well.  In Hawaii, growing conditions vary so much - there are so many different micro-climates -  that it’s impossible for us to guess what will do well.  If you live in Hawaii, we suggest asking your neighbors what varieties do  well for them.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="3"><p><strong>How much  of your seed is organic?</strong></p><p> 71% of our  varieties, as of the 2025 catalog.  This  percentage has been slowly increasing over time.  We’re carrying more organic seed all the  time, but there are many varieties that we just can’t get organically right  now.  Certified organic varieties are  marked with the green "OG" symbol. Since certified organic farmers must plant certified organic seeds when available, we prioritize offering USDA certified organic seed for varieties that are particularly well-suited to market gardeners.</p><p> Several of  our growers are using organic practices without getting the certification.  As of our 2025 catalog, this is about 14% of our varieties.  Usually these are small farmers who don’t  feel it’s worth their time and money to be certified.  In these cases, we use the green "e" symbol to note varieties that they’ve grown.  Some of these Eco folks have an alternative  certification through Certified Naturally Grown, which is not an Organic  certification, but uses roughly the same criteria.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="5"><p><strong>Is any of  your seed hybrid?</strong></p><p> Over 99% of  our seed is open-pollinated (non-hybrid).   In our 2025 catalog, we have 4 hybrids (1 broccoli, 1 onion, and 2  corns).  We carry these 4 hybrids because  they are exceptional performers, have no open-pollinated counterpart, and have  been requested by our customers. We offer hybrid sweet corns as a service to  customers who want to purchase hybrid corn seed that is free of fungicidal  treatment.  Our hybrids are all clearly  labeled as hybrid on our website, in our catalog, and on our seed packets.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="6"><p><strong>Is any of  your seed treated?</strong></p><p> We do not  sell any chemically treated seed.  A few  of our seed lots are dusted with diatomaceous earth, an organically-approved  insect deterrent.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="7"><p><strong>What does  "heirloom" mean?</strong></p><p> The most  conservative definition is: any variety dating to 1940 or earlier.  This is the definition we use for our catalog.  After 1940, most new plant varieties were  bred for large-scale chemical agriculture - for regular irrigation, chemical  fertilization and use of chemical pesticides.   Newer varieties are often less hardy than heirlooms.  However, this is a complex question, and some  folks think that "heirloom" can be applied to some post-1940 varieties.  ("Heirloom," like "antique," is a term than  is often adjusted over time.)  We use the hourglass symbol to note which varieties are heirlooms.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="8"><p><strong>Is your  seed GMO-free?</strong></p><p> We’ve signed  the <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/our-nongmo-policy-ezp-15.html#pledge">Safe Seed Pledge</a> - we don’t knowingly buy or sell  genetically engineered seeds or plants.  However,  we don’t test our seed lots for GMO contamination; the cost is prohibitive.</p><p> Corn has the  greatest risk of contamination.  Risks  also exist for cotton, soybeans, beets, chard, flax, rutabagas, turnips,  chinese cabbage, asian mustard (<i>B. rapa</i>), asian kale (<i>B. napus</i>), rapini, and some squash.   For some of these crops, the risk comes from  potential cross-pollination with canola or sugar beets.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="9"><p><strong>Do you  sell seeds from Monsanto?</strong></p><p>We don’t buy  anything from Monsanto, or from any company owned by Monsanto.  Several years ago Monsanto bought out a large  vegetable seed producer named Seminis that we previously got a few varieties  from; we either stopped carrying those varieties, or got our own growers to  produce them instead.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="10"><p><strong>What do  the numbers on your packets mean?</strong></p><p>Above the  crop type, we print the five-digit catalog number/ SKU we use for the  variety.  In the case of bulk packets, we  put a letter at the end of this number.  Below  the variety name, on the left, we print the germination percentage for the lot the seed came from.  (Often  the percentage that sprouts in a germination test will be higher than the  percentage that sprouts in a greenhouse or field, as in the lab no seeds will  be eaten, trampled, etc, and conditions may be more predictable.)  Below the germination percentage, we print  the date (month and year) when the seed was packed.  Below the variety name on the right, we print  the lot number that the seed came from, which we use to keep track of which seed came from which sources. Below the lot number, we print the minimum weight in  grams.  There are 28.35 grams in an ounce, or 0.035 ounce in a gram.  A seven-gram packet weighs about a quarter-ounce; a 14-gram packet weighs about half an ounce; 28-gram packet weighs  about an ounce; a 57-gram packet weighs about 2 ounces; a 114-gram packet  weighs about a quarter-pound; a 228-gram packet weighs about a half-pound; a  454-gram package weighs about a pound.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="11"><p><strong>Can I  order seed from you year-round?</strong></p><p>  Our seeds  and supplies are in stock year-round. Germination testing continues regularly  and we ship  seeds throughout the year.  Occasionally a variety becomes unavailable due to a crop failure, short supply,  or selling out due to high demand. Sold out varieties are indicated with the  product description.  Our prices are  updated in early to mid December when our new catalog comes out.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="12"><p><strong>Do you  sell bulk seed?</strong></p><p> We do offer a lot of bulk sizes, but none of the sizes we offer a really appropriate for large farms. For any given seed variety, if we have any bulk size(s) available, they’ll be in a drop-down menu just above the blue "add" button. If you’re looking for much more of a variety than the largest size we list on our website, you can email gardens@southernexposuire.com  .If it’s a small-seeded crop (tomatoes,  peppers, eggplant, okra, flowers, herbs, etc.) then there’s a good chance that  we’ll have enough seed to offer a bulk quote.   If it’s about larger seed (beans, corn, etc), then we probably can’t offer a bulk price, and might not even have enough available to sell you the full quantity  you’re looking for.  We are a small  company, and we just don’t have enough inventory/storage space to be able to sell large seed at low bulk prices.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="15"><p><strong>This  variety was in your catalog, but it’s listed as sold out the website?</strong></p><p> Early in the  winter, if a variety’s still in germination test, we’ll list the expected date  we hope to have the seed available, assuming the seed passes the test.  Later in the season, once a variety’s listed  as sold out, it’s generally sold out until the next winter.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="16"><p><strong>How many seeds do I get?</strong></p><p>The top of  each category page gives the typical packet size, how many seeds to expect, and  how many row-feet this plants in the garden (above the listing of products).  This information is also given at the bottom of the <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides-library-ezp-41.html#vegetable">growing guide</a> for each crop.   Any exceptions are noted at the end of the  variety descriptions.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="17"><p><strong>My seeds  didn’t germinate!</strong> </p><p> All our seed  lots have their germination tested.  The  percentage that germinate in our tests is printed on the left side of the  packet, above the packing date.  Our  <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides-library-ezp-41.html#vegetable">vegetable growing guides</a>, also printed in our catalog at the beginnings of their respective crop sections,  have lots of useful growing information, including about how to get different  crops to germinate.  Feel free to give us a call if you’d like further advice or if, in spite of appropriate conditions, your seeds don’t germinate.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="18"><p><strong>How long will my seeds last?</strong></p><p> Most seed  will last for 2-4 years if stored in a cool, dry, dark place.  For  best quality, seed needs to be fully dry before storing.  Most seeds will keep best if stored in an  airtight container in the freezer.</p><p> Be aware  that germination goes down over time, so you may need to sow more of your older seed to get the number of plants you want.  We offer seed saving <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/supplies-c-216.html">supplies</a> to help you dry and store seed for longer periods. </p><p> Some types  of seed, like onions and parsnips, lose viability much more quickly. For these it is best to buy or save new seed each year.</p><p> Older seed  can be used in the kitchen! </p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="19"><p><strong>How  should I store my seeds?</strong></p><p> Store your  seeds in a cool, dry, dark place, and keep them protected from insects.  An airtight container in the freezer works  best for most seeds.  A mason jar with a  two-piece lid is suitable; when using other jars, it’s best to seal the rim by  wrapping it in a thin strip of <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/sealinggrafting-film-supply-p-1147.html">sealing and grafting film</a>.  Be sure to let the container return to room  temperature before opening it.   Otherwise, water may condense on the seeds and cause rotting or premature sprouting.</p><p> A good rule  of thumb is that the sum of the temperature (in Fahrenheit) and the percent  humidity should be less than 100 (the seed storage index). For example, seeds  stored at 50% humidity and 40 degrees Fahrenheit will have a seed storage index  of 90 (50 + 40 = 90). In general, the cooler and drier you keep your seeds (the  lower the seed storage index), the longer they will last. </p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="20"><p><strong>How long before I can harvest this variety?</strong></p><p> Days to  maturity is generally given at the beginning of the description for each  variety. Days to maturity is based on our experience here in Central Virginia  (zone 7a).  Maturity will vary with your own location, time of planting, weather,  etc. For example, beans planted in June (when it’s hotter and days are longer) will mature faster than beans planted in April. For most crops we give the number of days from sowing.  For certain crops, like tomatoes and broccoli,  we give the number of days from transplanting to harvest; this is specified at  the end of the crop’s <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides-library-ezp-41.html#vegetable">growing guide</a>.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="21">  <p><strong>Why don’t  you grow seed potatoes here in Virginia?</strong></p><p> Potatoes  grow best in cooler climates.  It’s  healthiest to have the seed potatoes grown in cold areas like Maine, where our  potato grower (<a href="http://www.woodprairie.com/">Wood Prairie Farm</a>) is located.   This keeps the potatoes from getting diseases that could be passed on to  customers? properties.</p></div>

<h2>Shipping Questions</h2>
<div class="question-answer" name="22"><p><strong>How much do you charge for shipping and handling?</strong></p><p> Our minimum shipping charge is $4.50, which is for orders under $10.00.  For orders of $10.01-$30.00, we charge $5.50; for orders of $30.01-$60.00, we charge $7.50; for orders of $60.01-120.00 we charge $8.50.  For orders over $120, we charge 8% of the order total.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="23"><p><strong>Can I  pick my seeds up instead of having them shipped to me?</strong></p><p> We don’t  have a storefront.  Except on scheduled  tour days, we don’t allow customers to pick up seeds at our farm.  Our seed business is run out of a crowded  office on our farm, and too often when someone has tried to pick up an order,  it’s meant extra time to track down the order.</p><p> We do have  booths at various agricultural events.  Our  seeds are also available in <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/retail-stores-ezp-17.html">nearby retail stores and garden centers</a>, but many of our varieties are  available only by catalog.  If you would  like to see our seeds offered in a store near you, you can give them the  contact information for our seed racks program, to seedracks (at) southernexposure.com and phone # (540) 894-7890</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="24"><p><strong>Can you mail  seeds abroad?</strong></p><p> Generally, we do not take international orders. Research and seed-saving organizations may contact us for an exception. We will need to calculate postage costs before providing a total.</p><p>It takes a lot of  time to fill out customs forms and calculate foreign shipping, and too often  the seeds sent to other countries get lost in the mail or don’t make it through  customs.  Phytosanitary certificates are beyond our means.</p><p> We cannot under  any conditions mail peanuts or live plant material abroad, even to Canada.  Live plant material includes potatoes, sweet  potatoes, mushrooms, garlic, perennial onions, perennial leeks, shallots, ginseng and goldenseal.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="46"><p><strong>Can you ship to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and US Territories?</strong></p><p>We can ship <em>seeds</em> to these locations, with the exception of Ginseng seed, and, in the case of Hawaii, Job’s Tears seed and St. Johnswort seed, and, in the case of Puerto Rico, morning glory seed.</p>
<p>We cannot ship potatoes, sweet potatoes, bulbs, rootstock, or live plants to Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, U.S. Territories, or APO/ FPO (military) addresses.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="25"><p><strong>Can you  ship UPS?</strong></p><p> We’re sorry,  we can’t.  We only use the US Postal  Service.  Using two different shipping  systems is too complicated, and UPS is not set up to pick up from our  farm.  Sometimes our potatoes are shipped  via UPS directly from the farm that grows them in Maine.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="26"><p><strong>Can you  ship to P.O. boxes?</strong></p><p> P. O. Boxes  are fine unless you’re placing a very, very large order.  Orders over 10 lbs may occasionally ship UPS. </p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="27"><p><strong>Can you  ship via extra-fast mail, such as Next Day Air?</strong></p><p> We’re really  not set up to do this.  It would take us  a 30-minute round trip to drop off the package, and in addition the postage itself would cost quite a bit.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="28"><p><strong>Do you  have tracking #s for packages?</strong></p><p> Yes, in 2016 we switched to a postage system that adds a tracking number to each package and includes the tracking numbers in our order shipment e-mails.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="30"><p><strong>I placed  an order but forgot an item.  Can I add  it to avoid paying for shipping twice?</strong></p><p>We’re sorry,  at this point we can’t add items to orders after they’ve been placed.  This is partly because once we’ve printed an order out, adding an item would require finding the physical paperwork.  Given our high volume of orders, this is often time-consuming, and especially so when our order volume is highest and we’re and most pressed for time trying to get everyone’s seeds in the mail as quickly as we can.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="31">  <p><strong>When can I get seasonal items?</strong></p><p> You may  order seasonal items year round, but they will be shipped separately from the  rest of your order, at a time appropriate for planting.  <strong>Potatoes and sweet potatoes</strong> are shipped  in the spring, to southern-most areas first. <strong> Perennial onion bulbs, garlic, ginseng and  goldenseal</strong> are shipped in the fall, to northern-most areas first. There are  shipping surcharges are for all seasonal items. </p><p> We have  found that fall planting of perennial onions gives superior results in most  areas of the country, with yields often twice those obtained from spring  planted bulbs. Ginseng, goldenseal, and garlic also are best planted in the  fall. All fall seasonal shipments come with a growing guide. We begin shipping fall  items in September.</p><p> Potatoes  ship directly from the farm in Maine where they are grown. Shipments begin in  March. Earlier shipments are not possible due to the danger of freezing damage in transit.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="32"><p><strong>Why can’t  you ship peanuts to California, cotton to Georgia, milk thistle to Texas, etc.?</strong></p><p> Some states  prohibit the shipment of certain kinds of seed into the state.  We can’t make exceptions.  The laws are either about protecting large  commercial crops like peanuts and cotton from possible bugs and diseases, or  about preventing "nuisance" plants like milk thistle from escaping into the  wild and becoming weeds.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="33"><p><strong>If you  send seeds by mail, will they be irradiated?</strong></p><p> No. The only  mail the post office irradiates is to government buildings in Washington D.C.  (for zip codes 20201-20597).</p><p> For a while  after the anthrax scare in 2001 the post office did consider irradiating mail  sent everywhere.  But the machines were  too slow and expensive and so they gave it up.</p><p> (Note that a  lot of our seed is mailed to us by our growers, and so if the postal service  were irradiating, it would already be irradiated.)</p><p> We’re sorry,  but we can’t honor special requests to mail packages Parcel Post or UPS.</p></div>

<h2>General Questions</h2>
<div class="question-answer" name="34"><p><strong>Where can  I find your organic certificate?</strong> </p><p> We’re  certified by QCS, which is based in Florida.   </p><p>Threre’s a link to a pdf of our current organic certificate at the bottom of our <a href="/about-us/">About Us</a> page.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="35"><p><strong>Why  haven’t I gotten my catalog?</strong></p><p> We mail  catalogs in December to anyone who has requested a catalog - or ordered from us -  in the previous two years.  We only send  bulk catalog mailings to U.S. addresses; Canadian customers need to contact us  directly to ask us to send a catalog first class.  During the busy season (January-April), we try  to mail out catalogs each week to new customers and folks who ask for one; the  rest of the year, it’s every 2-4 weeks if we have catalogs available.  If you expected a catalog with the initial  mailing but still haven’t received one in January or if you don’t get one for 3 weeks or so after requesting one, call us and we’ll be happy to mail you  another.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="36"><p><strong>Can I  send you a seed sample?</strong></p><p> Yes! However, we’ve got a backlog of things to trial, so we may not get the chance to  actually grow it out for a few years!  If  you do send one, it’s very helpful if you enclose information about it: where  it’s from, history, how it tastes, methods of preparation, any non-food uses, etc.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="37"><p><strong>Can I  come visit your farm?</strong></p><p> Since 2011 we have organized yearly Southern Exposure farm tours for customers in the summer.  We hope to have such farm tours a couple  times a year, in the future - but we’re not making promises!  We regret that we are not able to invite  customers to our property at other times, and we do not have a storefront.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="38">  <p><strong>Why don’t  you have such-and-such seed this year?   You used to!</strong></p><p> If it had  low sales, we may have decided not to carry it this year - especially if it’s  carried by various other companies.  But  it’s more likely that there was a crop failure.   There are various ways a crop failure may come about:  1) bad weather, 2) harvested seed having low  germination, 3) pests (bugs, crows, deer, raccoons, etc.) eating the plants or  the seed, 4) early frosts, 5) illness, 6) other.  Wholesale companies as well as small growers  can have crop failures and small crops.   Many varieties we carry are unique and we’re the only catalog offering  them, so if there’s crop failure, we’re out of seed until another crop can be  grown.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="39"><p><strong> When do you make seeds from new crops available?</strong></p><p> As crops are  harvested, cleaned and tested, varieties that have been sold out start going  back up on the website in October and continue through December.  Varieties we haven’t offered before become  available in December, when the new catalog comes out.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="41"><p><strong>Can I get free catalogs to give out/for an event/for a class, etc?</strong></p><p> Yes! However, depending on our supply and the time of year, we may not have as many as you  want.  It’s helpful if you request the  catalogs far enough in advance that we can mail them at Media Rate (much cheaper!)  Send an e-mail to gardens  (at) southernexposure.com </p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="42"><p><strong>Can  someone from SESE come do a table at my event, or give a talk to my garden group?</strong></p><p>Sometimes we  can, sometimes we can’t.  Send an e-mail  to Ira (at) southernexposure.com </p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="43"><p><strong>When do I plant?</strong></p><p>We provide a <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides/recommended-planting-dates.pdf">recommended planting dates</a> as a pdf and in out catalog. These are for the Mountains, Inland Plains, and Coastal regions of the mid-Atlantic. They may be used as guidelines elsewhere.  Use your own dates of  last spring frost and first fall frost to determine which column works best for  you.  Our <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides-library-ezp-41.html#vegetable">growing guides</a> include suggested planting times, generally  relative to your last frost dates.  Depending on where you live, your local or state <a href="http://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension">agricultural extension service</a> may provide guidelines as to when to plant.</p></div>
<div class="question-answer" name="44"><p><strong>How do I save my own seed?</strong></p><p> Our <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides/saving-seeds-home-use.pdf">Basic Guide to Seed-Saving for Home Use</a> can get you off to a  good start.  The  <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides-library-ezp-41.html#vegetable">growing guide</a> for each crop includes recommended isolation distance for home use.  Professional quality seed has stricter  isolation distance requirements.  The  bottom of our  <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/growing-guides-library-ezp-41.html">growing guides and library page</a> also includes links to several  other seed-saving resources.  </p><p> Consider  minimum population size to maintain genetic diversity and prevent inbreeding  depression. This varies over a large range with larger populations required for  out-crossing crops. For home use a handful of tomato or string bean plants may  suffice, but broccoli requires 60-100 plants and corn at least 200.  Crops that are mostly self-pollinating can be  maintained with relatively few plants and better recover from population  bottlenecks.</p><p> We sell  several <a href="http://www.southernexposure.com/books-dvds-c-14.html">books</a> on saving seeds.</p><p> There are  two basic types of seed saving: wet and dry. <strong>Wet seed saving</strong> includes  tomatoes, eggplant, watermelon, melon, cucumbers, and squash. These seeds must  be separated from that fruit and some have a coating that can inhibit germination.  We usually briefly ferment these seeds, which helps separate and clean them from  the pulp and breaks down the germination-inhibiting coating. Fermentation  simply means letting the seed sit in its pulp, often with added water, and  stirring 2-3 times a day. Depending on the temperature and seed type, 1-3 days  may suffice. Fermenting for too long could induce sprouting!  After fermentation, separate seeds from pulp  and dry the seeds. <strong>Dry seed saving</strong> includes corn, beans, lettuce, okras,  the brassica family, and most herbs. Generally these seeds simply dry on the  plant, or may be harvested just before they finish drying. Depending on your  climate, you will most likely need to bring these seeds indoors to complete  drying.  Even if they appear fully dry at  harvest, most of these should be allowed to sit in their seed casings for a  couple of weeks to ensure that drying is complete.</p><p>Once  seed is fully dry, it’s a good idea to freeze it in an airtight container for  at least 48 hours, to make sure there aren’t any live bugs in it.</p></div></div>
