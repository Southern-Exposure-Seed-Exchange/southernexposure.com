    <p><strong>Our Mission</strong><br>We encourage cooperative self-reliance in agriculture.
        We promote and participate in seed saving and
        exchange, ecological agriculture, reducing energy use,
        providing locally adapted varieties, and regional food
        production.
        To further these aims, Southern Exposure offers:
        heirloom varieties to conserve and distribute rare and
        endangered varieties; open-pollinated varieties to
        encourage seed saving and exchange among gardeners;
        disease- and insect-tolerant varieties to reduce pesticide
        use; and varieties for local and small-scale growers to
        encourage regional food production. </p>

    <p><strong>What we offer</strong><br>
        Southern Exposure Seed Exchange offers about 850 varieties of <a
            href="http://www.southernexposure.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=3">vegetable</a>, <a
            href="http://www.southernexposure.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11">flower</a>, <a

            href="http://www.southernexposure.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=29">cover crop</a> seeds. We
        emphasize varieties that perform well in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, although gardeners and farmers over the
        country grow our seeds. As of 2025, over 60% of the varieties we offer are <a
            href="https://www.southernexposure.com/organic/">Certified Organic</a>, and over 60% are <a
            href="http://www.southernexposure.com/our-seed-growers-ezp-138.html">grown by small farmers we know and
            contract with directly</a>. We offer many unusual Southern heirlooms, <strong><img

        including peanuts, southern peas, naturally colored cotton, collards, okra, roselle, turnip greens, corns for

    <strong>Our business structure</strong><br>
    We are a worker-run cooperative where every worker has a voice in the decisions of the company and where workers
    receive equal compensation regardless of the economic value traditionally placed on the jobs done. We strive to
    provide a flexible and enriching work environment where each person is inspired to take on multiple roles and to
    think creatively about how we can continue to improve our work. We have a commitment to quality in all aspects of
    our service to our customers.

    <strong>Our location</strong><br>
    Southern Exposure Seed Exchange is located in the rolling hills of central Virginia, on Monacan land, between
    Richmond and Charlottesville, not far from Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s Monticello. Our 72-acre farm has goats, chickens,
    hayfields, an herb garden, and extensive vegetable gardens for seed production, trialing, and eating. Recently, we
    hold an open house at least once a year, and we may have additional public events here in the future. However, we do
    not have a storefront, and our location is not open to the public on a day-to-day basis.<p></p>

    <strong>Our seed storage and testing</strong><br>
    All our seed storage areas are air conditioned, refrigerated, or frozen for long-term viability. We also dehumidify
    our seed curing and seed storage areas to prolong seed viability. Our seed is germination tested to ensure it meets
    both federal and Southern Exposure standards (our standards are higher than federal standards for some varieties.)
    Test results are printed on the packet to help you determine planting density and quantity needed. Please note that
    germination tests are often conducted under optimum conditions and that field results may vary.<p></p>
